# Sugar Catppuccin login theme for SDDM

![Preview](./Preview.png)

This SDDM theme was built **for my personal use** using the [SDDM Sugar Dark](https://github.com/MarianArlt/sddm-sugar-dark) project and the [Catppuccin Mocha Color Scheme](https://github.com/catppuccin/catppuccin) as a base.

## Installation
The instructions for installing the theme are the same as for [SDDM Sugar Dark](https://github.com/MarianArlt/sddm-sugar-dark).

## Customization
The instructions for customizing the theme are the same as for [SDDM Sugar Dark](https://github.com/MarianArlt/sddm-sugar-dark).
